# HubSpot-Fixes

These are code snippets that I routinely use to fix SEO/audit errors for HuBSpot hosted websites.

## [Blog Listing page](https://github.com/mtabor66/HubSpot-Fixes/blob/main/Duplicate-headers-bloglisting)

This fixes the duplicate content and canonical errors for blog listing pages, by creating unique titles and descriptions.
I add this to the "Additional Head Markup" on the blog template.

## [Pagination](https://github.com/mtabor66/HubSpot-Fixes/blob/main/pagination)

This hides the pagination when the blog listing page only has one page. This is to prevent duplicate content errors.
I add this as a wrapper around the pagination code. 

## [Duplicate H1s on Blog Posts](https://github.com/mtabor66/HubSpot-Fixes/blob/main/blog-banner)

This shows the banner only on listing views.

## [Blog Tag Listing](https://github.com/mtabor66/HubSpot-Fixes/blob/main/blog-tags)

This gets a list of all available blog tags so you can do something with them.
