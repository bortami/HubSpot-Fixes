# HubSpot-Fixes
These are code snippets that I routinely use to fix SEO/audit errors for HuBSpot hosted websites.

# Blog Listing page
This fixes the duplicate content and canonical errors for blog listing pages, by creating unique titles and descriptions

# Pagination
This hides the pagination when the blog listing page only has one page. This is to prevent duplicate content errors.
